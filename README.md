## TODO

- [x] Add note to run myoudp and start leap stream executables before doing anything else
- [x] Fix gripper
- [x] The In/Out and Up/Down do the same thing but we have no way to rotate the robot, going to use the left hand fist to rotate in one direction.
- [x] The mode filters don't work, we don't really understand why. 
- [ ] Knit and purl aren't being identified remotely correctly, vastly too much jitter even with a stationary human.
- [x] Need to add the cue to do the training data part of the script
- [ ] Update control logic
- [ ] Verify in lab: ModeFilter, movement directions
- [ ] Add interaction with actin viewer
- [ ] Knitting circular paths
- [ ] Yarn gripping mechanic?
