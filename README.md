## TODO

- [ ] Add note to run myoudp and start leap stream executables before doing anything else
- [ ] Fix gripper
- [ ] The In/Out and Up/Down do the same thing but we have no way to rotate the robot, going to use the left hand fist to rotate in one direction.
- [ ] The mode filters don't work, we don't really understand why. 
- [ ] Knit and purl aren't being identified remotely correctly, vastly too much jitter even with a stationary human.
- [ ] Need to add the cue to do the training data part of the script
